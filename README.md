# AMX BSS API

amx-lib-bss

This library contains the code to interface with BSS Soundweb London devices,
like the BLU series products.

It is assumed the developer has read the Soundweb London Interface Kit
documentation ([London DI Kit.pdf](http://www.jands.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/38475/London_DI_Kit_v2.pdf))
provided by BSS. The conventions used in this library try to follow the
terminology used by BSS. A copy of the PDF is installed in the London Architect
application directory, which by default is:

```text
    C:\Program Files\Harman Pro\London Architect\London DI Kit.pdf
```
